## SELF-SUPERVISED PRETRAINING FOR EEG ANALYSIS V1.1
A Foundational Model for Brain Signals 
ABSTRACT
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a valuable neuroimaging tool widely used in healthcare, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), and cognitive research. However, EEG analysis faces challenges, including data scarcity, task-specific models, and high computational costs due to the need for training separate models for each task. 

This research proposes a self-supervised pretraining (SSP) framework for learning general-purpose EEG representations from unlabeled data , which can then be fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks. The novelty of this work lies in developing a unified, task-agnostic model that generalizes across multiple EEG applications, including seizure detection, emotion recognition, cognitive workload estimation, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis.   

The study explores will explore various self-supervised learning  (SSL) techniques, including masked signal prediction, contrastive learning, and generative pretraining. This approach enhances is expected to enhance efficiency, generalization, and flexibility, positioning it as a foundational model for future EEG research.
